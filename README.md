# Image-Text-Extractor
This project uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to detect and extract text from images. The program preprocesses images, identifies text regions, and converts them into readable text, which is saved to a file and optionally displayed. This project is ideal for automating text recognition tasks in scanned documents, photographs, or other image files.
